A desktop music player that provides a beautiful, fullscreen interface to your music library. It's built for those who appreciate a clean aesthetic and intuitive control. Whether you prefer using your keyboard or a gamepad, Vinyl offers a seamless way to navigate your tunes without ever needing to reach for a mouse.

We created Vinyl for music lovers who want to truly connect with their music, bringing back the intentionality of listening to a record.

## Developer Section

### Linting

To lint Vala code, you can use [vala-lint](https://github.com/vala-lang/vala-lint), a tool designed to detect potential issues and enforce coding style in Vala projects.

Read the instructions to install it on your local machine.

**Usage**

Run `io.elementary.vala-lint` command in your project source code directory:

```sh
io.elementary.vala-lint src/
```

### Validating AppStream Syntax

To ensure your [AppStream XML file](data/io.github.libredeb.vinyl.appdata.xml.in) is correctly structured, use the `appstream-util` tool from the [AppStream project](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/appstream/docs/).

**Installation**

```sh
sudo apt install appstream
```

**Usage**

Run the following command to validate the syntax of your AppStream XML file:

```sh
appstreamcli validate --pedantic data/io.github.libredeb.vinyl.appdata.xml.in
